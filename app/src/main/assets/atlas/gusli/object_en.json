In that functional sense, it has more relationship to a harp or zither than to a hammer dulcimer.</p><p>Gusli has a strong, resonant, sweet and even silvery sound. </p><p>Its amplitude depends on how hard the string is plucked, its pitch is high, with the sound having long duration if not interfered with.</p><p>The gusli is most often played upright, with the edge of the long end down on the knees; the left hand damps the strings not in the chord/melody, while the right hand strums or plucks the strings.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/gusli/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/gusli/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/gusli/featured.png","caption":"Wing-shaped gusli is much smaller and has more resemblance to Baltic psaltery.\n\nIt is held much more like modern guitars."},"icon":{"path":"atlas/gusli/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-11-16T04:44:50Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"Family","value":"STRINGS"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"Russia","area":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":6.0,"mask":771},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Lullaby by Shakhanov","samplePath":"atlas/gusli/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/gusli/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":{},"related":[{"index":43,"display":"Guzheng","definition":"The guzheng, also known as Chinese zither, is a Chinese traditional plucked musical string instrument.","iconPath":"atlas/guzheng/icon.jpg"},{"index":41,"display":"Guqin","definition":"The guqin is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family.","iconPath":"atlas/guqin/icon.jpg"},{"index":52,"display":"Koto","definition":"A Japanese stringed instrument usually having 13 silk strings stretched over a long, hollow, wooden body.","iconPath":"atlas/koto/icon.jpg"}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusli","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about gusli.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gusli","display":"The Free Dictionary","description":"Gusli definition on dictionary.","iconPath":"link/thefreedictionary.png"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v_ktzgIitY","display":"YouTube","description":"Beautiful and Pensive Gusli Solo","iconPath":"link/youtube.png"}]}
