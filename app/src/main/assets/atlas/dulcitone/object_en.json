{"index":36,"rank":8,"name":"dulcitone","display":"Dulcitone","definition":"A keyboard instrument similar to the celesta, in which hammers strike a set of tuning forks for sound production.","description":"<p>A dulcitone is a keyboard instrument in which sound is produced by a range of tuning forks, which vibrate when struck by felt-covered hammers activated by the keyboard.</p><p>The tuning forks give off a sound very similar to a celesta, but rounder and sweeter, with less piercing harmonics.</p><p>The tuning forks are acoustically coupled to and thus amplified by a spruce soundboard that rests under the instrument.</p><p>A significant feature of the dulcitone was its portability, a product of its lightweight and compact construction and the fact that the tuning forks were not prone to going out of tune.</p><p>The dulcitone is a transposing instrument; it sounds an octave higher than the standard written pitch.  It has a five octave written range.</p><p>However, the volume produced is extremely limited, and the dulcitone's part is frequently substituted by a glockenspiel.</p><p>The dulcitone continues to play a role in popular music.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/dulcitone/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/dulcitone/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/dulcitone/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-11-06T16:43:38Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"Family","value":"KEYBOARD"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[],"startDate":{"value":1860.0,"mask":1},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Bernstein - One Hand, One Heart","samplePath":"atlas/dulcitone/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/dulcitone/waveform.png","facts":[],"features":{},"related":[{"index":21,"display":"Celesta","definition":"A musical instrument with a keyboard and metal plates struck by hammers that produce bell-like tones.","iconPath":"atlas/celesta/icon.jpg"},{"index":47,"display":"Harpsichord","definition":"A keyboard instrument whose strings are plucked by means of quills or plectrums.","iconPath":"atlas/harpsichord/icon.jpg"},{"index":61,"display":"Piano","definition":"A musical instrument with a manual keyboard actuating hammers that strike wire strings, producing sounds that may be softened or sustained by means of pedals.","iconPath":"atlas/piano/icon.jpg"},{"index":63,"display":"Pipe Organ","definition":"An instrument consisting of a number of pipes that sound tones when supplied with air and a keyboard that operates a mechanism controlling the flow of air to the pipes.","iconPath":"atlas/pipe-organ/icon.jpg"}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulcitone","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about dulcitone.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dulcitone","display":"Merriam-Webster","description":"Dulcitone definition on Webster.","iconPath":"link/merriam-webster.png"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS5d5SG1wZ8","display":"YouTube","description":"Dulcitone 1900 | Blessed are the music makers","iconPath":"link/youtube.png"}]}
