They taught the inventors about vibration and resonation. The physicists were Uwe Hansen and Thomas Rossing.</p><p>Hang has a highly intuitive note-layout design, featuring a complimentary scale of notes zig-zagging around  a central note.</p><p>As a consequence, playing a wrong note on any Hang instrument that follows this design, is something that is near impossible.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/hang/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/musical-instruments/hang/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/hang/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/musical-instruments/hang/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/hang/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/musical-instruments/hang/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-11-13T17:26:51Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"PERCUSSION"}],"aliases":["Hang drum"],"spreading":[],"startDate":{"value":2000.0,"mask":1},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Hang Solo","samplePath":"atlas/hang/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/hang/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/musical-instruments/hang/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Sometimes referred to as a 'hang drum'","value":"Some people refer to the Hang as a 'hang drum' but the inventors of the instrument do not like this term."},{"name":"25 years of research","value":"Prior to the release of the Hang there had been 25 years of research in regards to the steel pan and its acoustics and construction technology.
