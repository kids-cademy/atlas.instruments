The keys connect to hammers that strike a graduated set of metal plates suspended over wooden resonators.</p><p>The sound bars of the celesta are usually made from steel. The keys on the keyboard strike the hammers above, which strike the steel. The steel bars rest on hollow wood resonators. The sound is mellow, warm and rich.</p><p>The sound of the celesta is similar to that of the glockenspiel, but with a much softer and more subtle timbre.</p><p>Anyway, the celesta does not produce loud sound and it does not have the same dynamic range as a piano.</p><p>One of the best-known works that uses the celesta is Tchaikovsky's 'Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy' from The Nutcracker. Celesta is also used on modern and contemporary, pop and rock music.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/celesta/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/celesta/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/celesta/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-10-16T07:09:21Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"Family","value":"KEYBOARD"}],"aliases":["Celeste"],"spreading":[],"startDate":{"value":1886.0,"mask":1},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Tchaikovsky - Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy","samplePath":"atlas/celesta/sample.mp3","facts":[{"name":"The celesta is normally used for gentle passages","value":"The celesta is normally used for passages that are meant to sound gentle and soft as it produces piercing music when played hard."},{"name":"The celesta is also used in music styles other than orchestras","value":"The celesta is also used in music styles other than orchestras and classical music.
