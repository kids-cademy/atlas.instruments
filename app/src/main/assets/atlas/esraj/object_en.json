All strings are metal.</p><p>The soundboard is a stretched piece of goatskin similar to what is found on a sarangi. </p><p>Occasionally, the instrument has a gourd affixed to the top for balance or for tone enhancement.</p><p>Although both esraj and dilruba, bear almost twin technical characteristics, there are a few differences which justify their having two separate identities.</p><p>The main difference between the esraj and dilruba is the shape of their soundbox. The dilruba has a broad rectangular sound box, whereas the esraj has a roundish, oval- shaped one.</p><p>The esraj is a young instrument by Indian terms, being only about 300 years old.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/esraj/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/esraj/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/esraj/featured.png","caption":"The esraj has characteristics in common with sarangi.\n\nSarangi resemble the sound of the human voice – is able to imitate vocal ornaments."},"icon":{"path":"atlas/esraj/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-11-06T10:36:51Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"Family","value":"STRINGS"}],"aliases":["Dilruba","Indian Harp"],"spreading":[{"name":"India","area":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":18.0,"mask":259},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Gayatry Mantra","samplePath":"atlas/esraj/sample.mp3","facts":[],"features":{},"related":[{"index":22,"display":"Cello","definition":"A four-stringed musical instrument of the violin family, pitched lower than the viola but higher than the double bass.","iconPath":"atlas/cello/icon.jpg"},{"index":31,"display":"Double Bass","definition":"The largest bowed stringed instrument in the modern orchestra, also used frequently in jazz ensembles, especially played pizzicato.","iconPath":"atlas/double-bass/icon.jpg"},{"index":79,"display":"Viola","definition":"A stringed instrument of the violin family, slightly larger than a violin, tuned a fifth lower, and having a deeper, more sonorous tone.","iconPath":"atlas/viola/icon.jpg"},{"index":80,"display":"Violin","definition":"A stringed instrument played with a bow, having four strings, an unfretted fingerboard and a shallow body, and capable of great flexibility in range, tone, and dynamics.","iconPath":"atlas/violin/icon.jpg"}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esraj","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about esraj.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v488qzY6kpA","display":"YouTube","description":"Rare Indian Instrument - the Esraj | Raag Bhairavi | Arshad Khan | Music of India","iconPath":"link/youtube.png"}]}
