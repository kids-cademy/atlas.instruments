The comb is the term for the main body of the instrument, which contains the air chambers that cover the reeds. </p><p>Reeds are pre-tuned to individual pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reed’s length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end.</p><p>Harmonicas produce their musical sounds from the vibrations of reeds in the harmonica's metal case. </p><p>A harmonica is played by using the mouth to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed.</p><p>An important technique in performance is bending: causing a drop in pitch by making embouchure adjustments.</p><p>Harmonicas are used in blues music, folk music, rock and roll music, and pop music. A special type of harmonica, the chromatic harmonica, is used in jazz and classical music.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/harmonica/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/harmonica/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/harmonica/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2019-11-06T21:16:42Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"Family","value":"WOODWIND"}],"aliases":["French Harp","Mouth Organ"],"spreading":[],"startDate":{"value":19.0,"mask":259},"endDate":null,"conservation":null,"sampleTitle":"Sonny Boy - Harmonica Solo","samplePath":"atlas/harmonica/sample.mp3","facts":[],"features":{},"related":[{"index":0,"display":"Accordion","definition":"A portable wind instrument with a small keyboard and free metal reeds that sound when air is forced past them by pleated bellows operated by the player.","iconPath":"atlas/accordion/icon.jpg"},{"index":6,"display":"Bandoneon","definition":"A musical instrument similar to a large concertina, especially popular in Latin America.","iconPath":"atlas/bandoneon/icon.jpg"},{"index":28,"display":"Concertina","definition":"A small instrument with bellows like an accordion but with buttons in place of keys.","iconPath":"atlas/concertina/icon.jpg"}],"links":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica","display":"Wikipedia","description":"Wikipedia article about harmonica.","iconPath":"link/wikipedia.png"},{"url":"https://www.britannica.com/art/harmonica","display":"Encyclopædia Britannica","description":"Harmonica article on Britannica.","iconPath":"link/britannica.png"},{"url":"https://kids.kiddle.co/Harmonica","display":"Kiddle","description":"Harmonica facts for kids.","iconPath":"link/kiddle.png"},{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/harmonica","display":"The Free Dictionary","description":"Harmonica definition on dictionary.","iconPath":"link/thefreedictionary.png"},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Play-a-Harmonica","display":"wikiHow","description":"How to Play a Harmonica","iconPath":"link/wikihow.png"},{"url":"https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Harmonica","display":"wikiHow","description":"How to Clean a Harmonica","iconPath":"link/wikihow.png"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFbfY-wY1I","display":"YouTube","description":"Sonny Boy Williamson harmonica solo.","iconPath":"link/youtube.png"}]}
